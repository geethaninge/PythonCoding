"""Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains those values that are:
(a) even numbers, and
(b) from elements in the original list that had even indices

For example, if list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list,
since it is also at an even index (i.e., 2) in the original list. However, if list[3] contains an even number,
that number should not be included in the new list since it is at an odd index (i.e., 3) in the original list.
